 POLITICS_ATTLEE_DESC:0 "Having resoundingly defeated a humiliated Churchill in the post-war snap election, Clement Attlee brought the Labour party to power for its first majority government in history. Attlee's government so far is most famous for building the welfare state, and other such domestic reforms, as well as a reasonably moderate foreign policy, working not to escalate the “cold war’ with Germany, and attempting, somewhat unsuccessfully, to reform the slowly collapsing colonial system of the British Empire. Despite the attempted reforms at home and abroad, however, the 1940s have been a disaster for the United Kingdom as a whole, and the once mighty empire is seeing signs of collapse. 1952 will see a time of great change for Britain, asan especially important general election coincideswith huge developments in Nazi Europe."
 POLITICS_HITLER_DESC:0 "Saviour of Germany, conqueror of Europe, destroyer of the Slavic Judeo- Bolsheviks, first Fuhrer of the Greater German Reich, Adolf Hitler, once a relatively obscure extremist politician, came to power over a weakened Germany in 1933. Under his National Socialist government, Germany won a series of miraculous victories against the entente powers, and then fought a 5-year 'Crusade against Bolshevism', finding itself master of the European continent by 1946. Hitler now stands as the most powerful man in the world, ruling from Germania, as remaining puppets bow to his power and 'subhuman races' are crushed under his boot. With age, however, he is falling increasingly ill and and mad, and as huge fractures begin to become apparent in the Nazi New World Order, it is clear a successor will have to replace him soon."
