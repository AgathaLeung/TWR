 POLITICS_ATTLEE_DESC:0 "Having resoundingly defeated a humiliated Churchill in the post-war snap election, Clement Attlee brought the Labour party to power for its first majority government in history. Attlee's government so far is most famous for building the welfare state, and other such domestic reforms, as well as a reasonably moderate foreign policy, working not to escalate the “cold war’ with Germany, and attempting, somewhat unsuccessfully, to reform the slowly collapsing colonial system of the British Empire. Despite the attempted reforms at home and abroad, however, the 1940s have been a disaster for the United Kingdom as a whole, and the once mighty empire is seeing signs of collapse. 1952 will see a time of great change for Britain, as an especially important general election coincides with huge developments in Nazi Europe."
 POLITICS_HITLER_DESC:0 "Saviour of Germany, conqueror of Europe, destroyer of the Slavic Judeo- Bolsheviks, first Fuhrer of the Greater German Reich, Adolf Hitler, once a relatively obscure extremist politician, came to power over a weakened Germany in 1933. Under his National Socialist government, Germany won a series of miraculous victories against the entente powers, and then fought a 5-year 'Crusade against Bolshevism', finding itself master of the European continent by 1946. Hitler now stands as the most powerful man in the world, ruling from Germania, as remaining puppets bow to his power and 'subhuman races' are crushed under his boot. With age, however, he is falling increasingly ill and and mad, and as huge fractures begin to become apparent in the Nazi New World Order, it is clear a successor will have to replace him soon."
 POLITICS_BERIA_DESC:0 "Head of the NKVD, Lavrentiy Beria served as Stalin's de facto right hand man before and during the Nazi-Soviet war, having a large role during Stalin's purges, and following the collapse of the USSR and the death of Stalin, was one of his expected successors. In 1952, he commands the remnants of the Soviet Union and the Red Army from his base in the Ural region, safe from German attacks due to its distance and isolation. His power, however, is not the total command Stalin enjoyed, and he faces fierce competition within the Communist Parts as to who will lead to the Soviet Union through reunification and liberation of thee European homelands."
 POLITICS_SERGEI_DESC:0 "At the time an uknown Colonel, Sergei Wojciechowsky served under Kolchak's white forces in the Russian civil war. Escaping Russia, he was involved in the Czechoslovak army from 1921 until the German occupation. At first, Wojciechowsky tried to keep a low profile as he was watched by the Gestapo, until the later stages of the Nazi-Soviet war when German authorities began more thoroughly rooting out resistance in Europe, at which point he miraculously escaped to the west via Turkey, becoming a prominent Russian emigre. Following the American expedition in the Russian Far East, he became leader of the new Russian State with its provisional capital in Vladivostok, backed by the US. A vehement anti-Nazi and anti-Communist, as well as a supporter of pan-Slavism, Wojchiechowsky is determined to reunite Russia and drive the German oppressors from Russian and Slavic lands."
