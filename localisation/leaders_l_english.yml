 GER_HITLER_DESC:0 "Saviour of Germany, conqueror of Europe, destroyer of the Slavic Judeo-Bolsheviks, first Fuhrer of the Greater German Reich, Adolf Hitler, once a relatively obscure extremist politician, came to power over a weakened Germany in 1933. Under his National Socialist government, Germany won a series of miraculous victories against the entente powers, and then fought a 5-year 'Crusade against Bolshevism', finding itself master of the European continent by 1946. Hitler now finds himself the most powerful man in the world, ruling from Germania, as remaining puppets bow to his power and 'subhuman races' are crushed under his boot. With age, however, he is falling increasingly ill and mad, and as huge fractures begin to become apparent in the Nazi New World Order, it is clear a successor will have to replace him soon."
