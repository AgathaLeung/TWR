 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "A New World"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Hitler's 'Thousand-Year Reich' under the Nazi party stands victorious in Europe, its empire spanning from Calais to Arkhangelsk. As the British Empire crumbles, the torch of democracy is passed to the rapidly growing industrial powerhouse in the United States. In the east, the Kuomintang consolidates control over China, while remnants of the Russian army regroup across the Urals and Siberia. The war ended only 5 years ago, but with the unexpectadly fragile New World Order seeing signs of collapse, nobody can know how long the peace will hold."
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Victorious in the First World War, the United Kingdom was defeated in all but name in the Second. The rapid collapse of France and unending air war led most to believe victory was impossible with a Germany that now ruled all of Europe save the Soviet Union. An armistice signed in early 1941 put Britain’s most immediate problems at rest, but by this time the damage was already done, and in 1952 the UK stands weak and unstable, its Empire all but gone, a lonely bastion of democracy in Europe."
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Defeatism and nightmares of the Great War infested French leadership, and was a major factor in its collapse to a young Nazi Germany in 1940. With the war in the west over, the old, increasingly ill Philippe Pétain rules the new French government with nearly dictatorial power, forced to toe the line with Berlin to keep France's autonomy. However, over a decade after the end of French democracy, cries of Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité are heard through the streets, with France's weak army unable to keep down dissent. As Pétain's government becomes increasingly weak and unstable, it remains to be seen if Hitler's puppet in Paris can rule for long"
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Hitler's 'Thousand-Year Reich' under the Nazi party stands victorious in Europe, an empire spanning from Calais to Arkhangelsk, free to shape the continent to its will. At first glance, the iron rule of the Reich is invincible, its armies stand supreme and the Reichskomissariats continue to colonise the new territories in the east, while all governments in Europe bow to its hegemony. However, as Hitler grows old, and the line of seccession within the party remains unclear, instability that had been forced down with military might now begin to bubble back up to the surface. The Third Reich has won, but how long can its New Order hold?"
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Italy stood alongside Germany as a victor in the War, but the mostly lacklustre performance of its armies did not go down well at home. Mussoloni's dreams of a new Roman Empire have begun to be realised, boasting an expansive empire in Africa and a sphere of influence over the Mediterranean. However, old tensions with Hitler and the Nazis have bubbled back up, with the Balkans again being the centre of these new disputes. The old European Axis partners are drifting apart, and Mussoloni is determined the next war cannot be another 'humiliation'."
 CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After nearly half a century of instability, China seems to at last be on the verge of stable government. Chang Kai Shek and the Kuomintang, eliminating most of the warlords and opposing governments, now begin a new era in Asia after the end of Japanese dominance. As the European Empires crumble, radicals and communists rise up in the anarchy, while America spreads its influence across the pacific. The Republic of China once again become the bastion of stability in Asia and finally rid the continent of foreign influence."
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The western lands of the Soviet Union, from Arkhangelsk in the north to Astrakhan in the south, lie under the rule of Germany's genocidal colonial governments, with 'Generalplan Ost' well underway. The renmants of the Red Army and the Communist Party have fled to the vast Russian steppes, its temporary capital in Ufa, where soldiers and workers alike vow to liberate their comrades under the yoke of Nazism. To the east, the traitorous Russian government backed by America stands defiant, while seperatists in Siberia and central Asia declare independent states. One day, the red banner will again fly across Russia, and the Germans will pay for their crimes."
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United States never joined the war in Europe, watching in horror as Nazism overran the continent, but its war against Japan kickstarted the unstoppable machine of American industry. By far the world's largest economy, the US has seen the beginnings of an unprecedented economic boom, and with rapid expansion of its vast arms industry it has earned its title as the 'Arsenal of Democracy'. As British influence flounders across the world, America must pick up the torch as Democracy's defender, and as the previously isolationist nation spreads its influence across the world, it is clear a challenger to Germany's New World Order is rising."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:1 "After centuries in which the Polish nation has been divided between three empires, Poland now stands independent once again. But its position is not an easy one. \n\nIn the east, the Soviet Union has not forgotten the humiliating defeat in the Polish-Soviet war. \n\nIn the west, German Führer Adolf Hitler makes no secret of his desire for more "living space" - and that the former German areas now under Polish control will be the first step to achieve it."
 CAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Canada entered the Great War as a mere colony and left it as a nation. Born in the mud of Passchendaele, Canada now takes its first few uncertain steps onto the world stage. \n\nHobbled by the Great Depression and with internal divisions between Anglophones and Francophones, the future of this new nation looks anything but secure."
 AST_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Australians earned their place in the history books of the Great War in blood. The sacrifices made in the Gallipolli campaign have not been forgotten - and neither were those who ordered it. \n\nAustralia now stands at a crossroads: should she stay with her colonial master, about to be drawn into yet another conflict in distant Europe, or should the focus be on the threats that are appearing closer to home?"
 SAF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the Great War began, many in South Africa refused to take up arms for their British masters. The South African military spent most of the Great War chasing around German forces in their African colonies, with limited success. \n\nNow a new war looms on the horizon. Then as now, there are some in South Africa that think the country shouldn't be fighting against the Germans at all. Some even believe that the time has come for the descendents of the Boers to make their bid for the liberty that was denied to their forefathers."
 NZL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The tiny nation in the South Pacific fought bravely in the Great War, suffering high casualties in the bloody battles at Gallipoli and on the western front. Nearly half the men of fighting age had served in the fighting overseas, and many had not returned.\n\nSome twenty years after end of the Great War, the people of New Zealand look anxiously at the world stage, for this time, the threat of war seems to draw ever closer to their own home..."
 RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The crown jewel of the British Empire, the Raj of India is a strange combination of imperial power and imperial powerlessness. A tiny elite of British civil servants rule over a vast subcontinent filled with hundreds of millions of subjects. From their ranks recruits the Indian Army, which fought bravely in the Great War.\n\nIndian leaders hoped that the sacrifices made in the last war would help India gain her independence from Britain, but so far, that hope has been disappointed. With a new war looming, many believe that the time has come to take that freedom - by whatever means necessary."
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "Blitzkrieg"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "In the last few years the world has seen some new wars break out in Europe and Asia. Spain is now governed by nationalists and Japan has fought both the Soviet Union and China for territory, the latter being a more successful battle for Japan. The new non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany may be bad news for the rest of Europe."
 ENG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Although the United Kingdom emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundation of its great empire was shaken to its core. A generation of the country's finest were lost in the trenches of Flanders and Northern France, while unrest spread throughout the Commonwealth and massive debts accrued.\n\nWith the trauma of the last war still in fresh memory, the country now faces the prospect of another. It is becoming increasingly clear that there will be no Peace for Our Time."
 FRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The Great War still fresh in its memory, France faces a new conflict after Germany showed they have no intention to keep the peace. Strengthening border defenses and choosing Allies wisely may very well be the way for France to avoid a disastrous war.\n\n France was victorious once before, this time shall be no different!"
 GER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After the remilitarization of the Rhineland, the French and the British grew increasingly suspicious of Germany's intentions. The Munich Agreement gave Germany permission to annex the Sudetenland for the sake of its German people. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact guarantees non-aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union, but also specifies the partitioning of Poland between the two nations. \n\nGermany has waited too long for this moment. The time to act is now!"
 JAP_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "War is raging in the Southeast. Even though Japan suffered some losses early in '39, a big portion of Chinese territory is under Japanese control. Tension is rising in Europe, and while the Soviet Union is focusing their attention on those matters, they shouldn't interfere in the war in Asia. \n\nWhen China's resources are in Japanese hands, the Soviets will be easy to deal with."
 ITA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Mussolini, the dictator of Italy, achieved some fame as a peace keeper for his part in the Munich agreement a year ago. However, German territorial expansion has made Italy see there is more land to claim if an understanding with the Germans could be reached. \n\nAlbania has been conquered merely as a taste of Italy's military capabilities, and the rest of the world would do well to worry."
 SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Supporting Manuel Azaña and the 'Second Spanish Republic' during the Spanish Civil War has clearly shown where the Soviet Union stands in relation to Italy and Germany. Victorious over the Japanese army in several recent border conflicts, the Soviet Union currently seems a power too major for any single country to oppose. \n\nThe promise made by Germany to partition the Baltic States and Poland is welcome at this time."
 USA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The rising tension in Europe is worrying. Although not yet a real concern for the United States, the aggression shown by Germany could soon be heard all over the world. While things are quite peaceful in the west, military preparations may not be a bad idea, all things considered. \n\nShould the United States get drawn into another war, they will be the ones to end it."
 OTHER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."

 CZE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "During the Great War, Czech troops fought alongside the Entente forces all over Europe in an effort to secure recognition for their nation. Their efforts were successful and Czechoslovakia rose from the ashes of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. \n\nSince their explosive entry into statehood Czechoslovakia formed the 'Little Entente' alliance with Yugoslavia and Romania with the aim of suppressing Hungary's efforts to restore the Austro-Hungarian Empire, although as resurgent German power grows the political landscape of Europe is rapidly changing."
 HUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "One half of the late Austro-Hungarian Empire, Hungary was treated as a defeated enemy by the victorious Entente after the Great War. In the Treaty of Trianon, the country lost almost two thirds of its territory. Millions of ethnic Hungarians found themselves living outside its borders, and its economy was left in ruins. Harsh restrictions on rearmament were supposed to ensure that Hungary could never again threaten the peace in Europe. \n\nBut with the political climate in Europe shifting, the time may have come to finally right the wrongs of the past, and regain the former glory of the nation."
 ROM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Romania found herself on the winning side of the Great War, and as a result gained new territories and people - not all of whom were Romanians. To guard against the revanchionist desires of the countries that were forced to cede land, Romania has created a web of alliances all across the Balkans. In recent years, however, the country has concerned itself mostly with domestic matters, and the government of King Carol II has allowed these alliances to lapse. \n\nAs the political situation in Europe changes, Romania may well find herself standing alone - and vulnerable."

 YUG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Yugoslavia came into existence after the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes merged with the formerly independent Kingdom of Serbia in 1922. Initially Yugoslavia joined both the Little Entente and the Balkan Pact to secure their independence, but recently the assassination of King Alexander combined with growing internal pressure from nationalists and external pressure from Italy and Germany has caused drastic upheaval and reevaluation of their political and strategic position."
