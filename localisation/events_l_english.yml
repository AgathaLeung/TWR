 germany.1.t:0 "Hitler Falls Ill"  
 germany.1.d:0 "Our beloved Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler, already has a long life behind him and many great and noble achievements under his name, but his last days seem to be closing in. Yesterday, during his routine visit to the doctor, he was found with concerning symptoms which were then diagnosed as liver cancer."  
 germany.1.a:0 "We will pray for the Fuhrer's soul."  
 germany.2.t:0 "Hitler's Second In Command?"  
 germany.2.d:0 "With the Fuhrer's lifesake seeming more and more fragile our top officers have suggested we name him a sucessor, in case of anything happening to him."  
 germany.2.a:0 "Himmler!"  
 germany.2.b:0 "Goring!"  
 germany.2.c:0 "He does not need one."  
 germany.3.t:0 "Hitler dies!"  
 germany.3.d:0 "It was a beautiful spring afternoon. Birds were singing, the wind was whistling through the trees, and on that afternoon the Fuhrer of the German Realm, the chancellor of the state, the commander-in-chief of the Wehrmacht, liberator of the East, Adolf Hitler passed away in Köningsberg, Prussia. The cause of death was liver cancer. \n\nHis demise has already shook the nation to it's core, and with the law of succession being very incomplete has led to multiple factions vying for power. Göring has stepped in as a representative of the Nazi party, and as a charismatic and liked leader he isn't an unlikely candinate. Heinrich Himmler, however, has rallied the support of the SS and former war veterans and has already announced his plans to take the Fuhrer's office. What happens to Germany next is anyone's guess."  
 germany.3.a:0 "Goring is the new Fuhrer!"  
 germany.3.b:0 "Himmler is the new Fuhrer!"  
 germany.3.c:0 "The Reichstag will form a temporary government."  
 germany.5.t:0 "Himmler's Putsch!"  
 germany.5.d:0 "Ever since the death of Adolf Hitler [Root.GetLeader] has been under increasing pressure to take tougher action against the resistance movements in the east and west, but with the failing economy and political turmoil it has seemed unwise. Meanwhile, Heinrich Himmler had long been denouncing the Goering government as weak, and his claims seemed to have been strengthened by Goering's apparent cowardice. \n\n At noon [GetDateText], strategic points in towns and cities across the German eastern colonies were stormed and seized by the SS. Radio stations across the former-Soviet union announced that the government of Germany had been corrupted, and new leadership under Himmler was needed."  
 germany.5.a:0 "We will crush the traitors!"  
 germany.5.b:0 "The Reich can not fall with the decadent!"  
 germany.4.t:0 "Himmler Questions Government"  
 germany.4.d:0 "After our decision to leave him out of the head of government's office, Heinrich Himmler has begun a campaign to smear [Root.GetLeader]'s reputation, and he has made himself out to be the legitimate successor of Hitler. With his great popularity among the SS he is quickly gaining momentum with the people and this could mean trouble for [Root.GetNameDef]."  
 germany.4.a:0 "He can complain all he wants."  
 germany.6.t:0 "Himmler Asassinated!"  
 germany.6.d:0 "Yesterday evening, Heinrich Himmler stepped out of his personal auto on his way to the newly built opera hall in Minsk. He was here to listen to a fine music drama; Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen. Little did he know he was living his life's last moments. \n\nAt exactly 9:22 a bullet whizzed through the air and struck Himmler through the heart with a soft thud. As the officer collapsed to the ground gasping, the crowd around him descended into chaos. \n\nWith Himmler gone, and with our efforts to pacify his supporters the new government is confident that their rule will, indeed last a thousand years."  
 germany.6.a:0 "Good riddance."  
 germany.10.t:0 "Traitorous Elements"  
 germany.10.d:0 "Our investigation into the factions of our military and government has led into interesting places, and has given us results indicating corruption of massive extents. From a single lone outpost on the de-jure Russian border taking in illegal opioid imports to a Field Marshal's personal guard being involved in conspirating against the legitimate government, the dirt runs deep. The whole thing is more or less run by none other than Heinrich Himmler. \n\nOur new information will allow us to consider taking more action against the traitors in our state."  
 germany.10.a:0 "They will get what they deserve."  
 germany.11.t:0 "Night of the Red Diamond"  
 germany.11.d:0 "The night started with quiet, but that did not last long as the calm was penetrated across the Reich with screams of pain. In under an hour, hundreds of corrupt military officers, corprals and other personell were murdered by the SS, the elite forces in many occasions turning on their former leaders. This night, very reminiscent of the 'Crystal Night' almost two decades past, showed the power of the new government in bloody fashion."  
 germany.11.a:0 "Justice has been served once again."  
 germany.12.t:0 "Fresh Officers"  
 germany.12.d:0 "As the army schools open their doors for a new season of recruits, recently trained officers rush to fill the power void in our military's ranks. It seems as if the country is recovering from the wounds left by the purges committed."  
 germany.12.a:0 "Good!"  
 germany.13.t:0 "1. and 2. Militia Corps Mobilized"  
 germany.13.d:0 "Our call has yielded fruit. Thousands of fresh recruits rush to newly established Volksarmee-Zentren, ready to fight. These men, inexperienced but eager, have formed the backbone of the newly established 1. and 2. Milizkorps."  
 germany.13.a:0 "For Germania!"  
 germany.14.t:0 "3. Militia Corp Mobilized"  
 germany.14.d:0 "Our call has yielded fruit. Thousands of fresh recruits rush to Volksarmee-Zentren, ready to fight. These men, inexperienced but eager, have formed the backbone of the newly established 3. Milizkorp."  
 germany.15.t:0 "War Strengthens Economy"  
 germany.15.d:0 "When men go to battle, the empty factories left behind are quickly manned by the jobless, homeless, poor and woman. This combined with the increased demand for military and food production is helping kickstart our economy."  
 germany.15.a:0 "I guess war's not all bad?"  
 germany.17.t:0 "Agricultural Subsidies Success!"  
 germany.17.d:0 "The subsidies started by [Root.GetLeader] to help our farms modernize have seen great success, with many properties aquiring modern irrigation and slaughtering techniques. This will increase our output."  
 germany.17.a:0 "Wonderful!"  
 germany.18.t:0 "Agricultural Subsidies Failure"  
 germany.18.d:0 "The subsidies started by [Root.GetLeader] to help our farms modernize have seen near zero success, with many properties choosing to spend the money on luxuries instead of modernizing their equipment. We will have to end the program."  
 germany.18.a:0 "Damn sloths!"  
  
 germany.200.t:0 "Himmler's Bids for Power"  
 germany.200.d:0 "Heinrich Himmler is one of the top candinates for succeeding Hitler, and within his closest group of aquintances he is the undeniable top candinate for succeeding Hitler. The SS-Reichsfuhrer has a long career behind him, and he has seen the oppurtunity to extend his reach within Germany, with Hitler's health seeming more fragile by the day."  
 germany.201.a:0 "He can take his chances."  
 germany.201.t:0 "Göring's Bids for Power"  
 germany.201.d:0 "Reichsmarschall, President of the Reichstag, Reichmimnister of Aviation, Forestry, and Communication Technology Hermann Göring could be considered the second most powerful man in Germany, after Adolf Hitler of course. And as Hitler's lifesake wanes, the oppurtunity of succeeding the man grows more tempting to Göring. He has now announced his plans to peacefully succeed as Fuhrer once the time comes."  
 germany.200.a:0 "He can hope."  
 germany.202.t:0 "Hitler's Cancer Develops"  
 germany.202.d:0 "Adolf Hitler's cancer has reached terminal stages. Chances of recovering are below 1%."  
 germany.202.a:0 "This is it, then."  
 germany.202.b:0 "Fight to his last breath!"  
 germany.203.t:0 "Hitler's Last Wishes"  
 germany.203.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, death is seeming a hard certainty for the Fuhrer. He has become content with the idea, telling the doctors about how he knows he has achieved everything he ever wanted in his life. He has put forth one last wish:\n\n''Take me to my wife, take me to Kehlsteinhaus.''"  
 germany.203.a:0 "As he says."  
 germany.203.b:0 "We can still save him!"  
 germany.204.t:0 "Murder Attempt!"  
 germany.204.d:0 "Martin Bormann, once considered to be Hitler's right-hand-man, has been caught red-handed in the apartment of minister of propaganda, Joseph Goebbels. He had bribed Goebbls' servant in an attempt to poison Goebbels' drink, but had not planned for the man's paranoia. A drink tester had revealed the poison, and all had gone downhill for Bormann from there. \n\nWe now have Bormann in custody, and we must decide what to do with him."  
 germany.204.a:0 "Guilty! Execute him!"  
 germany.204.b:0 "This is too odd to not warrant an investigation."  
 germany.205.t:0 "Leads In Low Supply"  
 germany.205.d:0 "The investigation on Goebbels' murder attempt has so far returned null. It appears as if Bormann was indeed acting alone, and maybe it is wiser to end the investigations now."  
 germany.205.a:0 "Well, whatever."  
 germany.205.b:0 "Continue looking!"  
 germany.206.t:0 "Bormann commits suicide!"  
 germany.206.d:0 "After hearing of the investigation continuing, Martin Bormann has ended his days in a court hearing by swallowing cyanide!"  
 germany.206.a:0 "Very interesting."  
 germany.207.t:0 "Clues Lead to the Baltics"  
 germany.207.d:0 "An information agent, who our public detectives have been in contact with, has revealed information that traces a trail of money from Riga to Bormann's pockets. We will have to look into this further."  
 germany.207.a:0 "Excellent, progress."  
 germany.208.t:0 "Brawl of Zalja Street"  
 germany.208.d:0 "While inquiring about the ongoing murder attempt case, our men have been ambushed in Riga! The group was pounced on by a bunch of native men, who proceeded to beat four of our field investigators senseless."  
 germany.208.a:0 "Probably just local gangmembers."  
 germany.208.b:0 "Inquire Lohse about this!"  
 germany.209.t:0 "Fingers point at Lohse!"  
 germany.209.d:0 "Everything we have uncovered about Bormann's and Goebbels' case, along with the attack in Riga, point to Reichkomissar of Ostland, Hinrich Lohse. It is unclear what his motives are, but what is clear is him being a traitor to Germany!"  
 germany.209.a:0 "Demand Lohse steps down!"  
 germany.209.b:0 "This calls for military intervention."  
 germany.212.t:0 "Accusations!"  
 germany.212.d:0 "The central authority in Germania is accusing Reichkomissar Hinrich Lohse for indirect attempted murder, indirect attack on government personnell, and highest treason. He is required to step down, or risk being forcibly removed from office."  
 germany.212.a:0 "Lohse did nothing wrong!"  
 germany.212.b:0 "He will be forced to step down."  
 germany.210.t:0 "Defial of Authority"  
 germany.210.d:0 "Hinrich Lohse has denied all accusations of treason, and refused to step down from office in RK Ostland."  
 germany.210.a:0 "We will see about this..."  
 germany.210.b:0 "Action will be taken."  
 germany.211.t:0 "Coup in Ostland"  
 germany.211.d:0 "Thanks to our quick response, the Lohse's government has been overthrown and treasonous elements have been removed from RK Ostland. Investigations can now be closed."  
 germany.211.a:0 "Great job everyone!"  
 germany.213.t:0 "Intervention in Ostland"  
 germany.213.d:0 "The treasonous actions of attempted murder, attack on public officials, and most importantly defying Germanian authority, have cast the light of blame on Hinrich Lohse and his corrupt government. Troops are readying to march into Riga and remove Lohse from power."  
 germany.213.a:0 "Do it!"  
 germany.213.b:0 "On second thought..."  
 germany.214.t:0 "Traitors removed!"  
 germany.214.d:0 "With a quick strike into Riga, treasonous kleptocrat Hinrich Lohse has been arrested and Friedrich Franz has been put into his place. Another display of German efficiency!"  
 germany.214.a:0 "Indeed."  
  
 germany.50.t:0 "Beginning Reichsbahn Ost"  
 germany.50.d:0 "The railway networks of the eastern, conquered territories of the [Root.GetName] have always been limited, scattered and low in quality. Recently [Root.GetLeader] has ordered the construction of a massive united railway network, complete with 50+ stations and weekly schedules for this area. The project is named 'Reichsbahn Ost' \n\nSome have criticised this plan as foolish and overcomplicated, with experts pointing to the flaws of the proposed rail-grid and the current financial situation of Germany. Nevertheless Reichsbahn Ost is getting built, and what is certain is that our great nation will gain prestige, jobs and might from it."  
 germany.50.a:0 "It'll get all the funding it needs!"  
 germany.51.t:0 "Additional jobs boost economy."  
 germany.51.d:0 "The Reichsbahn Ost is a gargantuan project that requires thousands of workers to complete. Of course unpaid labour will be used to an extent, but many people will have to be hired if we wish to complete it. This has created a lot of vacant jobs for the unemployed to fill, therefore helping our economy recover."  
 germany.52.t:0 "Reichsbahn: Prussian Lines"  
 germany.52.d:0 "The Reichsbahn Ost project has started and the first thing our engineers suggest we work on is tidying up the lines in Eastern Prussia."  
 germany.52.a:0 "Of course!"  
 germany.52.b:0 "I'm getting second thoughts..."  
 germany.53.t:0 "Reichsbahn: Warschau"  
 germany.53.d:0 "What used to be central Poland is a poor and ravaged region, but it's important as a centre of our Reich. The Reichsbahn Ost project looks to build a few large railtracks in the area."

 germany.53.b:0 "I'd rather stop this project."  
 germany.54.t:0 "Reichsbahn: Galizien-Wilno"

 germany.55.a:0 "Ok."  
 germany.55.b:0 "No."  
 germany.56.t:0 "Reichsbahn: Meinha Area"  
 germany.56.d:0 "The capital of RK Ostland and de-facto capital of Eastern Germany, Meinha along with the rest of White Ruthenia is helplessly isolated from the surrounding large cities due to destroyed and lacking transport systems. We should expand Reichsbahn Ost to the area."  
 germany.56.a:0 "They'll get their funding."  
 germany.56.b:0 "We have no need to develop the Untermenchs' land."  
 germany.57.t:0 "Reichsbahn: Kiev-Gotenburg"  
 germany.57.d:0 "The comission of Reichsbahn Ost has announced Ukraine to be next in line for construction. Our government budget is running low, though."  
 germany.57.a:0 "We will finish this project!"  
 germany.57.b:0 "Yeah, nah."  
 germany.58.t:0 "Reichsbahn:  Moskau"  
 germany.58.d:0 "Ever since the war, the Russian heartlands have been notoriously ravaged and underdeveloped. The big hurdle now would be extending the central rail network across the plains into Moskau."

 germany.58.b:0 "I will not allow this madness to continue!"  
 germany.59.t:0 "Reichsbahn:  Petersburg-Arkhangels"  
 germany.59.d:0 "What the engineers promise to be the last step for this project is building a track from the city of Sankt Petersburg to Arkhangels."  
 germany.59.a:0 "Soon we'll be done!"  
 germany.59.b:0 "The 'engineers' won't get the last word..."  
 germany.60.t:0 "Reichsbahn Ost Finished."  
 germany.60.d:0 "The premature cancellation of Reichsbahn Ost has been a dissapointment to many; nevertheless, we have now drawn up the timetables and lines of the new and improved network, and service shall commence tomorrow evening. This new infrastructure will be sure to speed up the development and integration of our eastern provinces, while showing the world the might of German industrialism!"  
 germany.60.d_2:0 "With the construction of Reichsbahn Ost coming to a close, the air is tense. High-level officials from all around Germany queue up for the first-ever rides on the great locomotives, ready to take passengers on a trip from Krakau to Moskau and everything in between.

 germany.100.t:0 "The Germanic State of Gotenland"  
 germany.100.d:0 "Ever since the German victory on the eastern front, the Crimea region had been a focus point for colonisation. With almost all of the local Ukrainian, Russian and Tartar populations killed or expelled, German civilian colonists arrived from the Reich by boat and train to the new territory to build a new in the colonies. Reichskomissariat Gotenland became a 'jewel in the crown' of the Nazi eastern colonies, and both a civilian and military hub for the Greater Reich. \n\nWith the outbreak of the civil war, the region was quickly taken over by SS-forces, but not long after Himmler declared total victory over the peninsula, it was cut off from the mainland in the north by invading forces. With the civilian government long dead, SS commander Jakob Sporrenberg took full military control, and with no sign of relief, declared an independent Nazi state, the Germanic State of Gotenland. \n\nSS rule was especially strict in this new state. Those few non-Germans that were left were annihilated soon after the nation's founding. All able-bodied civilians were conscripted either to defend the young state or to work to support the army in building and maintaining military infrastructure. Colonists who had enjoyed a luxurious seaside life only a few years before were now in a living hell, surrounded by enemies and fighting for survival."

And now, seeing the might of the New German Reich, and with the backing of Heinrich Himmler, the people of Berlin have started an open uprising, seizing the former capital of the legitimist government and much of it's supply storages."

Berlin has yet to respond, but in their current weakened state, it is unlikely this breach of the 1941 armistice will bring any response."

 news.1000.d:0 "It was a beautiful spring afternoon. Birds were singing, the wind was whistling through the trees, and on that afternoon the Fuhrer of the German Realm, the chancellor of the state, the commander-in-chief of the Wehrmacht, liberator of the East, Adolf Hitler passed away in Köningsberg, Prussia. The cause of death was liver cancer. \n\nHis demise has already shook the nation to it's core, and with the law of succession being very incomplete has led to multiple factions vying for power. Göring has stepped in as a representative of the Nazi party, and as a charismatic and liked leader he isn't an unlikely candinate. Heinrich Himmler, however, has rallied the support of the SS and former war veterans and has already announced his plans to take the Fuhrer's office. What happens to Germany next is anyone's guess."

 news.1004.d:0 "Ever since the death of Adolf Hitler [GER.GetLeader] has been under increasing pressure to take tougher action against the resistance movements in the east and west, but with the failing economy and political turmoil it has seemed unwise. Meanwhile, Heinrich Himmler had long been denouncing the Goering government as weak, and his claims seemed to have been strengthened by Goering's apparent cowardice. \n\n At noon [GetDateText], strategic points in towns and cities across the German eastern colonies were stormed and seized by the SS. Radio stations across the former-Soviet union announced that the government of Germany had been corrupted, and new leadership under Himmler was needed."

He was here to listen to a fine music drama; Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen. Little did he know he was living his life's last moments. \n\nAt exactly 9:22 a bullet whizzed through the air and struck Himmler through the heart with a soft thud. As the officer collapsed to the ground gasping, the crowd around him descended into chaos."

With the civilian government long dead, SS commander Jakob Sporrenberg took full military control, and with no sign of relief, declared an independent Nazi state, the Germanic State of Gotenland. \n\nSS rule was especially strict in this new state. Those few non-Germans that were left were annihilated soon after the nation's founding. All able-bodied civilians were conscripted either to defend the young state or to work to support the army in building and maintaining military infrastructure. Colonists who had enjoyed a luxurious seaside life only a few years before were now in a living hell, surrounded by enemies and fighting for survival."

And now, seeing the might of the New German Reich, and with the backing of Heinrich Himmler, the people of Berlin have started an open uprising, seizing the former capital of the legitimist government and much of it's supply storages."
